## Description:
This is a simple React decision-making application that accepts items(options) from the user and randomly selects and renders one in a modal. The app uses _LocalStorage_ to store the user's options so that they can be viewed again later. See the [usage](#usage) section for a more detailed explanation on how to use this application.


I learnt how to use and implement SCSS as well as configure a webpack file. The playground folder contains practise code and a jsx version of the application.

This application was created using _ReactJS_, as well as _React Props_, State(JSON) and LocalStorage.

The [playground folder](./src/playground/) contains practise code I used to understand the concepts better, with a version of the application written in JSX.

| :---------------------------------:|


```javascript
const appRoot = document.getElementById('app');

const renderApp = () => {
	const template = (
		<div>
			<h1>{app.title}</h1>
			{app.subtitle && <p>Subtitle: {app.subtitle}</p>}
			<p>
				{app.options.length > 0
					? 'Here are your options'
					: 'There are no options'}
			</p>
			
			<button disabled={app.options.length < 2 } onClick={onMakeDecision}>What should I do?</button>

			<button onClick={deleteAll}>Delete All</button>

			<ol>
				{app.options.map((option, index) => {
					{
						/* index creates unique numbers to id each option in the array */
					}
					return <li key={index}> {option} </li>;
				})}
			</ol>
			<form onSubmit={onFormSubmit}>
				<input type='text' name='option' />
				<button>Add Option</button>
			</form>
		</div>
	);

	ReactDOM.render(template, appRoot);
};

renderApp();
```
